# Ruby-Practice

This repo is meant to keep all of the Ruby and Ruby on Rails Practice

- To run a ruby file the command is "ruby {filename}"
- puts stands for Put String
- gets stands for Get String
- no need for a semicolon at the end of the command/ line
- # is the Comment marker
- another way to comment is :
  =begin

      ==
      !=
      >
      <
      >=
      <=

=end

- print will keep things on the same line and puts will skip to the next line
- Uppercase is used for Class in Ruby and a variable will start with a lowercase
